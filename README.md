Quadriga
========

Sunsetted client project. Bitcoin Exchange application. Client cancelled the project right before it was completed. It's my first attempt at a bitcoin exchange, I've learned quite a bit since then and it's somewhat embarassing to see this code now. Maybe It will help someone in the future.

This application was written with Symfony 2.3 and Doctrine ORM on top of MySQL. It utilizes the blockchain api for accepting bitcoin payments instead of a locally run bitcoind. It allows for currency conversion between any fiat currency and bitcoins. It also allows for western union and electronic fund deposits, no paypal integration by client request.

The final design was a template modified and enhanced by Mike Britton.
